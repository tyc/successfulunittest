# Setting up your project.

This is the second chapter.

I am going to try some **bold** and then some *italic* text.


	uint8 validateDigitalInput(uint8 in1, uint8 in2)
	{
		uint8 retVal = 0;
		
		if (in1 != in2)
		{
			retVal = in2;
		}
		else
		{
			retVal = in1;
		}
		
		return (retVal);
	}

	
In this chapter, I want to show why it is a good reason to do unit testing.
