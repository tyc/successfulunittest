# Introduction

During the construction of code, have you ever wonder if you code works without testing with the other code, or how close your code is what you are designing against. I have always wonder about the same thing. In my formative years after graduating from University in 1992, the notion doing unit testing was quite alien. It is even more so if it is applied to the world of practicing software engineering in the embedded space.

With the explosion of the internet and the all the technologies that go with enabling the thousands of apps, applying unit test to your code is occuring almost by default. However, in the embedded space, the practice is not so. It is almost as if it is not needed.

I notice a change about 10 years ago when consumer electronics started to get smart and applications written in Java were started to be deployed in them. 

In this book, it will go into some of the history of the unit testing. A good understanding of where unit test was derived from will show where it is heading.

It will show how to write code that is testable. To that end, it will suggest a project structure that will allow the project to unit test the code every time the build.
