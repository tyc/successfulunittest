# History of Unit Test
This is the first chapter.

I am going to try some **bold** and then some *italic* text.


	void main(void)
	{
		uint8 loop_index;
		while (loop_index < 0)
		{
			loop_index--;
		}
	}

	
In this chapter, I want to show why it is a good reason to do unit testing.

The project must be design so that it can be unit tested. one of the key activities is that design must start when the project is kicked off. To perform unit testing at a later date after the code has created, it may not work if the design is geared for unit testing.
